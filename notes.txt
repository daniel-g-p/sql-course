1. CREATING DATABASES
    - Execute SQL code -> Lightning icon
    - Load databases -> Refresh icon in "Schemas" tab
    - SQL keywords should be uppercased
    - Access database -> USE [DATABASE NAME]
    - Every query line must be terminated with a semicolon
    - Shortcut to execute all/selection -> CTRL + SHIFT + ENTER
    - Order of read queries -> SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER by
    - It's good practice to split queries into multiple lines
    - Lines preceded by "--" are treated as comments


2. SELECT CLAUSE
    - Select all table columns -> SELECT *
    - Select specific columns -> SELECT column1, column2, column3
    - Selected columns will be shown in the specified Order
    - +, -, *, /, % are available as mathematic operations in SELECT statements
    - Label computed column -> AS clause (e.g. SELECT order_total * 0.75 AS discounted_total)
    - Select unique values in a table column -> SELECT DISTINCT column_name FROM table_name

3. WHERE CLAUSE
    - Filter products by fields -> WHERE keyword (e.g. SELECT * FROM table WHERE quantity >= 50)
    - Comparison operators: <, <=, >, >=, =, != (<>)
    - Strings must be encapsulated in quotes
    - Date format in MySQL -> 'YYYY-MM-DD'

4. AND, OR, NOT, IN, BETWEEN OPERATORS
    - Multiple conditions in WHERE statement -> condition1 AND condition2
    - AND/OR/NOT can be combined with IN
    - Between -> BETWEEN value1 AND value2
